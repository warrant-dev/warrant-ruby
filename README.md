Warrant.api_key = 'api_test_f5dsKVeYnVSLHGje44zAygqgqXiLJBICbFzCiAg1E='

# create a user
Warrant::User.create(user_id: "user123")

# check whether user slp951 has view access to report 7asm24

Weâ€™ve used a random API key in these code examples. Replace it with your [actual publishable API keys](https://app.warrant.dev) to
test this code through your own Warrant account.

For more information on how to use the Warrant API, please refer to the [Warrant API reference](https://docs.warrant.dev).

Note that we may release new [minor and patch](https://semver.org/) versions of this library with small but backwards-incompatible fixes to the type declarations. These changes will not affect Warrant itself.
